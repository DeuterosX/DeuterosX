      in it's parent and to determine whether a mouse event is valid for this control.
      
      Since it also acts as a button, it has an event - onclick. This event is called whenever a mouse up event occurs in the specified area.
      Another event, onmousemove, allows the developer to do something when a mouse is moved over the control. In this case, it's used to show a tooltip.

      The "background" property can be used to set how the background for this face should be drawn.
      At the time of this writing, a color, a background image and repeat mode can be specified.
      
      1) If any, background color is drawn first over the area specified using the "size" property.
      2) If any, background image is draw next. The texture is stretched to fit the "size" property.
      
      The repeat mode (unsupported at the moment) allows the developer to specify how the texture
      should be repeated if it doesn't fill the whole area.

    <background color="#00000000" />
    <size width="320" height="200" />
    
    <!-- 
      Apart from background, faces are built using individual controls. At this moment, there are two basic controls:
      
      1) Label - handles text rendering
      2) Face control - handles face rendering
      
      Using these, it is possible to build much.
      
      All controls have some properties in common:
      * Position (x, y) - This is used to offset the control's content by a specified amount.
      * Size (w, h) - This is used along with position (x, y) when handling mouse events to eliminate
                      controls which shouldn't receive the event in question.
      * Identifier (id) - This is useful in identifying controls, especially for debugging and 
                          for operation in which many controls are involved.
      * Hide (hide) - If a control is hidden, it doesn't render it's content and it doesn't respond to 
                      event propagation.
                      
      Apart from properties, you can set events; the code you set will be executed when the event launches:
      * onclick - Occurs when the user clicks the area of the control.
      * onmousemove - Occurs whenever the user moves the mouse over the area of the control.
      
      Note that all controls are rendered in the order in which they are specified here - this can
      cause some controls to be partially or completely obscured by later controls.
      
      Now for some examples:
    -->

    <!--
      Simple, constant valued label. Constant references always return the same value
      (in this case, "text" will always be "Hello world", color will always be "#eeeeee"
       and the font will always be "fntGui").
      
      Note that properties (and events) which are not specified will have their default value.
      For example, the position is not specified here and will have a default value (0, 0).
    -->
    <control type="label" text="Hello world" color="#eeeeee" font="fntGui" />
    
    <!--
      The "text" property uses a variable, "currentSystem". Variable reference reads the specified
      variable each time the property is evaluated. They are specified "$" + variable name.
      
      Note that variable names are case sensitive.
    -->
    <control type="label" x="4" y="20" text="$currentSystem" color="#ffffff" font="fntGui" />

    <!--
      This is an example of events.
      
      The "onclick" event is specified in the following control. As you can see, the "hide" property
      has been set to a variable, "testHide". In the onclick event handler we set the "hide" property
      to true, which in turn sets the "testHide" variable to true, which has the effect of hiding this
      control (since it's "hide" property is now true).
      
      It's important to understand that constant values simply cannot be changed - if we didn't set 
      the "hide" property to a variable, it would either be a constant reference (if we specified a value)
      or a null reference (if we didn't specify any value). Since neither null reference nor constant reference
      can be changed, this would cause an error.
      
      An alternative way to change the property would be to change the variable "testHide" directly.
      This can be done through the variable manager, either by directly calling Game.VariableManager.SetVariable
      or (preferrably, to keep the variables easier to manage) using helper properties in the mod core scripts.
      For an example, see Core.Variables.cs along with the next control.
    -->
    <control type="cface" faceId="systemName" y="40" w="80" h="16" hide="$testHide" onclick="(s,e) => { s.Hide.Value = true; /* Alternatively, we could write TestHide = true; */ }" />

    <!--
      This is another example of an event - this time instead of using an anonymous function an actual method
      of the Core class is used.
    -->
    <control type="cface" faceId="systemName" x="100" y="40" w="80" h="16" hide="$hideTest" onclick="HideTest_OnClick" />
    
    <!--
      Example of a control affecting other control through use of variables. The two buttons move the third control
      left and right, respectively.
    -->
    <control type="label" id="btnLeft" y="60" w="16" h="16" font="fntGui" color="#dddddd" text="&lt;-" onclick="(s, e) => { TestX -= 10; }" />
    <control type="label" id="btnRight" x="20" y="60" w="16" h="16" font="fntGui" color="#dddddd" text="-&gt;" onclick="(s, e) => { TestX += 10; }" />
    
    <control type="cface" id="eventTest" faceId="systemName" x="$testX" y="80" w="80" h="16" />
    
    <!--
      Another way of specifying properties is using script. There are two simple ways of doing this:
      1) Return - Written using the syntax "$=code", the expression is compiled as "return code;".
      2) Body - Written using the syntax "${ code }", the expression is compiled as "{ code }".
                Make sure there is a return statement in code, or face the wrath of the compiler.
                
      The two examples below are functionally equivalent - each just choses a different way
      to accomplish the same task.
    -->
    <control type="cface" faceId="systemName" x="20" y="$= 20 * 1" w="80" h="16" />
    <control type="cface" faceId="systemName" x="100" y="${ return 20 * 1; }" w="80" h="16" />
    
    <!--
      Scripted values can be used for pretty much anything. You can read and write variables,
      do both simple and complex animations, anything you can do in C# code.
      
      In this example, the label moves back and forth across the screen.
    -->
    <control type="label" font="fntGui" color="#dddddd" text="Moving text!" x="$=(int)(Math.Sin((float)Environment.TickCount / 1000f) * 100 + 100)" y="120" />
    
    <!-- 
      Often you will need to interact with other controls and faces. This is where things
      get a bit complicated.
      
      When you use scripted reference for a property value, you get a "sender" parameter.
      "sender" is kind of a tricky reference:
      When used in a GuiValue with a GuiControl reference, it contains that reference.
      Otherwise, it is the last control on the rendering stack (ie. it should contain the
      nearest GuiControl above itself).
      
      In this example, directly accessing the control/face hierarchy is used to position
      the control to the lower right corner of the root face.
      
      To understand this behaviour, more knowledge about the rendering process is required.
      Basically, both faces and controls have a Render method. In this method, all the
      draw logic is handled - faces render their controls, controls render themselves.
      
      GuiControl and GuiFace have a render stack. At the start of a frame, this stack is empty.
      Each time the Render method is called, the instance is added to the render stack.
      When the call returns, the last instance is popped off it.
      
      In essence, this means that while doing the rendering of any individual face/control,
      the developer has access to all the parents of the current face/control.
      
      This is very important, since unlike the typical gui designers, the hieararchy isn't
      fixed. The same face can be used any number of times during the rendering, each time
      in a different place in the hierarchy. In effect, this means that any instance field
      is shared between different appearances of the same face id. This is also the reason
      you can never change the reference of any property at runtime - changing this in one
      face would change it everywhere the face is rendered (since all the "appearances" of
      the facename would have the same GuiFace instance). Since you always have to be very
      mindful of where values for properties are coming from, it's much easier to actually
      keep track of it.
      
      All in all, this also means there are few limits to how many times and in what places
      faces can be repeated. Also, much less importantly, it saves some memory. However,
      on modern computers, this is quite negligible. More importantly, the design means
      the developers are pretty much forced into strutures well suited for tasks such as
      finding a control under the mouse (thanks to the inherent structure, in part imposed
      by the fact that only faces have backgrounds and only controls are allowed in a face).
      Another side effect is this architecture could be relatively easy to subdivide into
      tasks and spread accross different threads thanks to the fact that the GuiFace and
      GuiControl instances are effectively immutable - not that this would be necessary.
      Another useful feature of this design is that it's very easy to do a very accurate
      game save/load mechanism. Since the whole gui and most of the logic is built around
      game variables, preserving the state is only a matter of saving all the variables.
      
      The same approach is also used in the events. The sender parameter of the event
      callback method will contain the control and GuiFace.All and GuiControl.All can
      be used to retrieve parent faces and controls respectively.
      
      Knowing that, the mechanics of the example should be quite clear. We find the immediate
      parent face of the control, read it's width and substract the controls own width from
      it. Note that GuiFace.All (and GuiControl.All) being a stack means GuiFace.All[0] will
      always be the immediate parent (or itself), GuiFace.All[1] the parent of the parent
      etc. The root of the hierarchy would be GuiFace.All[GuiFace.All.Count - 1].
      
      As a whole, a bottom-top approach is used. Children ask their parents and in turn
      have little direct control over their own children (just like real life!).
